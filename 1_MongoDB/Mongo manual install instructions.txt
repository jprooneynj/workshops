Create a /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-3.4.repo file so that you can install MongoDB directly, using yum.

[mongodb-org-3.4]
name=MongoDB Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/$releasever/mongodb-org/3.4/x86_64/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-3.4.asc


sudo yum install -y mongodb-org

sudo service mongod start

You can verify that the mongod process has started successfully by checking the contents of the log file at /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log for a line reading

[initandlisten] waiting for connections on port <port>
where <port> is the port configured in /etc/mongod.conf, 27017 by default.

You can optionally ensure that MongoDB will start following a system reboot by issuing the following command:

sudo chkconfig mongod on

sudo service mongod stop

You can restart the mongod process by issuing the following command:

sudo service mongod restart
You can follow the state of the process for errors or important messages by watching the output in the /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log file.



Uninstall MongoDB Community Edition
